# Assembler-and-Simulator-based-on-RISC-V

This project is entirely based on the concept of assembly programming. The underlying Instruction Set Architecture used here is RISC V. Through Python programming, we developed an assembler which takes an input file and returns an output file containing binary code. All sorts of instructions were covered while programming the assembler.

Besides the Assembler, we even developed the simulator, which executes every instruction line by line and displays the status of all 32 registers and the Program Counter after every line. All the instructions are Fetched, Decoded and Executed in a non-pipelined structure. After executing the entire block of binary code generated by the assembler, the status of all the memory locations is displayed.
